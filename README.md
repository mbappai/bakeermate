# Bakeermate

An admin mobile app that provides tools for customising and managing clients orders for cake business owners of any scale.

## Problem statement

Over the years, there’s been an increase in the number of individuals interested in the cake baking business in Nigeria. While most of them harbour strong passions and interest towards this niche, sadly not many of them have proper accountability and business management expertise to guide them in managing their business regardless of the scale.

## Goal

The goal of this application at it’s core is to provide these three primary features:

- Combo board creation.
- Order customisation.
- Order management.

### Combo board creation

This includes the creation of the selection options which in our case, is the creation of different boards sizes with the flavours available to them as options. So that, when selecting flavours to customise, they can be selected from the board size that has the flavour.

### Order customisation

This is the core tool which is used for customising clients order request flow. A typical order creation flow is as follow

1. Select cake flavour available for the requested board size.
2. For multi-flavoured cakes, select desired flavour for each layer.
3. Set pickup time for order.
4. Write text-on-cake: Description for what to write on the cake.
5. Attach owner: Specify the name client the order being customised belongs to.
6. Switch between individual mode or wedding cake mode (optional)
7. Place order.

### Order management

This makes keeping track of orders at different stages much easier and convenient. There are 3 major stages an order could be in.

1. **New request :** An order is said to be in this stage immediately after an order is placed during customisation phase.
2. **Active order :** An order is said to be in this stage when the admin accepts the order at the first stage. If admin decides to reject the order, it gets thrown out instantly.
3.  **Completed order :** An order is said to be in this stage when the admin completes the order int the active stage.
